C:You arrive in front of Meadows and look out towards the Chapel. There are bodies floating all throughout the pond and the steeple is burning brightly with an intense fire in the background. The pond is colored a dark red and is accentuated by the burning chapel. You hear a trash can tip over near Chase to your right, but can't see anything. You look to your left and notice the glass on the Meadows door is shattered. Something you could definitely fit through. You look straight ahead and see smog coming out of the Physical Plant smoke stack.
