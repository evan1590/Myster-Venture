K:You walk outside and the weather has taken a violent turn. The wind is deafening and the rain is making it hard to see. As you walk towards the science center you hear a faint splashing which is becoming louder as you get closer. You run into the science center and as you're catching your breath the power goes out. The only thing illuminating the path are the blood red exit signs which you notice are dripping blood. You turn the first corner and see Detsy B. eating one of the fetal cats from her biology lab. (Insert fight here and more directions). You take a left down the CS, Math and Physics hallway and zombie Mike is walking towards you with a stack of papers that resembles a phone book. You stand your ground and as he gets closer you notice one edge of the stack is dripping blood and that, on the front, reads Exam 3. Now you take a slight step back and you're shaking and perspiring. He gets within striking distance. What do you do? (Give them options)
You survive Exam 3 and he stands there immobile for a few seconds. After he turns and walks away. You hear him mumble, "obviously no brains... had in algorithms... too much leisure time..." You can see lights coming out from the bottom of the door to the WHALE Lab on your right and see some monitors on in the CS Lab to your left.
