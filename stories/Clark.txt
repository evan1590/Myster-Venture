B:You arrive at Clark and the door is ajar. You peer inside and see some lights flickering, blood smeard on the wall and it is dead silent, but otherwise no nothing to fear. You walk inside and go down the hallway. You notice that the floor seems weak is some spots. With one wrong step you fall through the floor and your leg becomes crushed. Somehow between the blinding pain and the shock of falling through the floor you see an exit. You manage to hobble to the door and get outside. From here you see chase dining hall and the Meneely/ Watson Courtyard.
