A:You wake up in Young basement and rub your eyes to rid you of your temporary blindness (due to Chase food). The lights are flickering overhead and you smell an awful smell. You know it isn't the Chase food anymore, but smells like flesh (close enough?). You hear rattling to your right. A door is slightly ajar in front of you, and you see a staircase to your left.
