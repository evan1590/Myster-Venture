N:You walk into the Physical Plant and everything is ransacked. You hear banging behind a door and some soft, agonizing screams. You see various objects that could aid you in your journey if you explore around. The door to the exit in front of you, letting in the only light, is banging against the wall slighty due to the wind. You see through a broken window on your right Balfour and the lights flickering and some shadows pass by multiple windows. And to your left you see the Meadows parking lot full of abandoned vehicles, some flipped over (including the mini cooper that takes all of the good spots), and some with broken windows and flat tires. What to do?
