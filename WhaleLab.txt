O:RIGHT:Tom is over a camp stove making pork belly benedict and the fat is rendering very nicely. He greets you with a warm welcome and some eggs. You wait out the storm and later hear the SWAT teams come and swarm the campus. They gather the survivors (including you) and quarantine the campus. You have surivied this long good job! Maybe you are not a complete idiot.
