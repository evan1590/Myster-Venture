Library.txt

J:You have decided to go to the Library for the first time for a reason other than socializing. As you enter you hear some strange nosies, but think that they are toooooo far away to hurt you. Walking deeper into the lobby you see a computer on. The computer screen displays a message telling any surviver to go to Tech support. You make your way to the Tech support door, you decide that it couldn't hurt to see what is on the inside. You enter and see Dessie Jurand watching netflix and playing candy crush. As soon as she sees you, she offers her help and gives you supplies as usual. She also tells you that she heard Aom Trmstrong is in the Whale Lab and that it would be a great next place to go to. You thank her and make your way to the exit. From here you can go to the Old and New Science Center, or you could go back to the dimple and most likely die.
