Chapel.txt

I:As you approach the Chapel you hear singing... you approach carefully and peer inside. You see Destiny Bonyolo and the rest of her merry band of VUJ jammers. You decide to enter, however you forgot that you aren't a senior and walk through the front doors. As you pass through the doorway something falls off the wall and kills you... and the VUJ jammers offer your body as tribute.
